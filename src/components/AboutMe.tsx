                                        I am a Software engineer with expertise in <strong>Python, React, TypeScript, JavaScript. </strong>
                                        Proficiency in design tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and experience with both <strong>SQL (PERN)</strong> and <strong>NoSQL (MERN)</strong> technology stacks.
                                        I also have knowledge in <strong>CSS frameworks such as Bulma, Bootstrap, and Tailwind.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a recent bootcamp graduate specializing in <strong>React and Python</strong>, I am
                                        passionate about developing dynamic, user-friendly web applications. My
                                        expertise lies in building modern, responsive interfaces using React,
                                        while leveraging Python for backend services and data processing.

                                        Through intensive, hands-on training and real-world projects, I have
                                        developed a deep understanding of full-stack development, working with
                                        both front-end and back-end technologies. I enjoy solving complex
                                        problems, writing clean code, and continuously improving my skill set to
                                        stay current in the ever-evolving tech industry.
